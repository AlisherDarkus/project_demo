                    <li>- In close combat, Deadpool cut down criminals, thugs and yakuza with katanas faster than they could react;</li>
                    <li>- The reaction allows you to cut through several pistol bullets fired a meter in front of him, however, it is worth considering that Deadpool was ready to fire, and 6 of the 16 shots reached Wade's body. </li>
                    <li>- Calmly caught a steel axe flying by;</li>
                    </ul>
                <article>Deadpool's main ability is regeneration, which seems to increase over time - during the first part, 
                    he restored a severed hand in one evening, and in the second, around the same time, he completely grew his lower body, 
                    also survived the explosion of several barrels of fuel that tore him to pieces. Calmly continued to speak after falling 
                    from the roof of a multi-storey building, got up and left after a few seconds. Bullet wounds heal within a couple of minutes 
                    and mostly do not cause him any inconvenience, complete fractures of his arms and spine recovered in a few seconds, and if his brain is damaged, 
                    he will hallucinate until his brain is completely restored. Additional effects are partial immunity to poisons and drugs 
                    (Deadpool can drink a bottle of detergent without consequences and inhale a kilogram of cocaine in one gulp), almost complete insensitivity 
                    to pain and increased strength. A jump into the open hatch of an SUV from a height of a couple of tens of meters did not cause any serious injuries, 
                    bullet wounds cause only minor pain and rather anger, stop, but do not really interfere (pain, severe anger and some difficulty in moving caused 
                    only a gunshot wound in the buttock) . There were no serious injuries from the blows of Colossus and Ajax, which sent Deadpool flying several 
                    meters with blows against cars, leaving deep dents. The explosion of a pair of large oxygen cylinders that destroyed a one-story building did 
                    not cause serious damage either. Fractures of all limbs and burning alive do not prevent Deadpool from continuing the battle. He can easily cut 
                    off his hand without any signs of pain. He calmly adjusted his head, turned 180 degrees.</article>

                        he was able to give an equal fight to Ajax, who easily lifted a man with one hand and threw Deadpool

                    <li>- Deadpool is an excellent fighter and shooter - using only twelve bullets (in fact, only 7, he spent part of the bullets empty) 
                        he killed a group of bandits from about a dozen people, he performed an incredible trick - in a jump, being upside down, 
                        hit three bandits standing in row in the head. Two shots from pistols during a twisted jump, killed two bandits with a shot in the head. 
                        Able to shoot a creeping enemy directly in the forehead, without looking. But his main weapon can be called two katanas, 
                        with which he killed a group of Ajax mercenaries, whose training and equipment is not much inferior to special forces, 
                        single-handedly defeated a group of several yakuza; he also throws his katana excellently - he was able to hit the wheel o
                    f a moving motorcycle and threw the katana so that it would hit exactly with the handle. Wade's style combines sudden and 
                    seemingly illogical attacks, accurate shots during acrobatic stunts, which is why experienced criminals or militants cannot keep 
                    track of Deadpool's attacks. Accurately throws knives, can even kill a person by throwing a butter knife at him, is able to throw a 
                    knife exactly at the head from a couple of meters in a small photograph; or in the eye of an enemy running at him. He was able to break 
                    a man's neck by grabbing it with his feet. He fought on equal terms with Cable, although he surpassed Wade in terms of physical characteristics, 
                    weapons and technological progress. Cable easily breaks through concrete with his fists and bends thick metal pins. able to throw a knife from

                    enemy's vigilance and shoot him in the head as soon as he approached. 
                    Accurately calculated the number of rounds in the machine gun of one of the bandits and knew when he approached that he had run out of ammunition.</article>
