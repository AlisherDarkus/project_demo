   <h3><b>Biography:</b></h3>
   <article>For more than a thousand years, nine ninja clans have existed in our world, supplying the most stealthy and deadly assassins to those who can pay for their services. 
    Raizo is an orphan picked up by the Ozunu clan and his best pupil. 
    Trained from childhood to be a cold-blooded killing machine, the young man was still able to learn the brighter side of life. 
    In the person of Kiriko - a girl who was also brought up as a killer, but did not want to be one. Raizou's doubts turned into confidence when Kiriko, 
    who tried to escape, was executed in front of him. And soon, upon completion of his first mission, the young ninja opposed the clan that raised him. 
    Since then, Raizo has been hiding from the persecution of the clans for some time and interferes with their business by killing other ninja.</article>

                <br><article><b>Endurance & survivability:</b></article>
                <article>Overall level: low-meta human.</article>
                <article>Like other ninja, Raizo possesses much greater survivability than normal humans, 
                    due in large part to special body control techniques and the increased durability of various body tissues. 
                    The fighters of the Ozunu clan are able to completely suppress their hunger and thirst for long periods of time by willpower, as well as completely 
                    stop the bleeding from small wounds and significantly slow down from more severe ones, and are able to continue to fight at full strength 
                    after being hit by a car at medium-high speed and several hits from a pistol (provided that vital organs are not affected). 
                    Raizo himself survived after several severe wounds with cold weapons, multiple hits with shurikens 
                    (while they only stuck into him, while ordinary people are pierced through) and the subsequent fall into the river from the roof of a skyscraper. 
                     Raizo also possesses an incredibly high pain threshold and is able to endure the effects of three 
                    "True Pain" hits in a row without any loss in combat capability.
                    After another severe wound and being hit by a car, he was able to move independently for some time, until he lost consciousness 
                      from blood loss. Raizo also possesses an incredibly high pain tolerance and is able to endure the effects of three 
                      "True Pain" hits in a row without any loss in combat capability.</article>


                      <br><article><b>Accuracy :</b></article>
                <article>Overall level: peak human.</article>
                <ul>
                    <li>As a training, he lived blindfolded for a year and learned to fight blindly without loss of efficiency; </li>
                    <li>Raizo is able to hear someone else's speech from a distance of a couple of tens of meters through several thick walls or a heartbeat at a distance of several meters, and also hears everything that happens around him in a dream.</li>
                    <li>Able to tune in to individual sounds, ignoring the rest of the surrounding noise;</li>
                    <li>Trained to track a target by scent "like a wolf";</li>
                    <li>By relying on his senses, Raizo is able to accurately blindly determine the location of specific people in a room, detect the approach of other ninja from a considerable distance, determine if a person is lying;</li>
                </ul>

                <br><article><b>Special and Martial Arts:</b></article>
                <article>Overall level: Ninjutsu master.</article>
                <br><article>Like all Ozunu ninja, Raizo is able to become one with the shadow. In this state, he is completely invisible in dimly lit rooms, essentially representing an intangible blurry dark spot, and is able to instantly move at a distance of up to ten meters at high speed (and possibly teleport), while striking at the enemy. This technique can be used even in bright light, provided that the light source is not static (fire from a fire) and is also located far enough (a street lamp a couple of tens of meters away), however, becoming completely invisible does not work out. 
                    The ability is completely blocked by bright directional light from spotlights and, theoretically, sufficiently powerful household lamps, which forces the ninja to turn off the lights in advance in the building where the attack will be made.</article>
                    <br><article>Trained in a special meditation technique that accelerates the natural regeneration of the body many times over, which allows you to completely heal all wounds in a couple of seconds. 
                        Small wounds heal without a trace, while large ones leave scars. To use, you need to concentrate and make a few special gestures with your hands without moving. 
                        This technique is probably unable to heal injuries beyond the complexity of normal human regeneration, such as the loss of an arm or leg.</article>
                        <br><article>Master of hand-to-hand combat and combat with melee weapons. He is the best fighter in his clan, able to confidently fight several other ninja at the same time and practically not concede in a sword fight to the leader of the clan, Lord Ozunu (who, however, did not fight at full strength, trying to inflict as much pain on the traitor as possible). 
                            Defeated four ninjas at the same time in an open battle, then the second best fighter in the clan, without receiving a single wound. 
                            He owns the technique of hitting "true pain", which is a special blow with the fingers of the hand to the stomach, after which the victim experiences hellish pain 
                            for at least eight hours.</article>

                <br><article><b>Experience:</b></article>
                <article>Overall level: elite.</article>
                <article>Raizo is the best pupil of the Ozunu clan and, according to the clan leader, the only one who could become his successor. 
                    He spent most of his life in severe training, and subsequently hunted other ninjas (both singles and groups) and hid from persecution for several years.</article>
