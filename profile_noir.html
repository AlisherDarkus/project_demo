                <ul>
                    <li>- Noir's power allows him to calmly hold adult men at arm's length above the ground, holding them by the throat; </li>
                    <li>- He was able to nail Kimiko to the asphalt with a knife through the foot of a wild girl;</li>
                    <li>- Easily tears a person apart.</li>
                    <li>- sent a roundhouse kick moreover, flying several meters and demolished metal barrels for them, he was also able 
                        to throw a person out of the car with such force that he knocked out the trunk door of an SUV, kicked out the door of a moving car with a blow of two legs.</li>
                        <li>- Throws Starlight like a rag doll with such force that the heroine pierces through concrete walls and a thick supporting concrete column.</li>
                </ul>
                <br><article><b>Speed, agility, reaction speed:</b></article>

                <ul>
                    <li>- According to Mother's Milk, Black Noir runs and moves faster than a moving car. </li>
                    <li>- Attacked and slit the throats of the terrorist base guards faster than they could react.</li>

                <br><article><b>Endurance & survivability:</b></article>
                <article>Overall level: meta human.</article>
                <ul>
                    <li>- pistol bullets simply ricochet off his body (possibly due to armor), 
                        but it is quite possible to shoot through his brushes, which, however, does not even slow him down; </li>
                    <li>- Withstood point blank explosion that destroyed almost everything inside the floor of a small building.</li>
                    <li>- Easily withstood the impact of Starlight's energy blasts, which drove Noir into the stone wall with such force that it cracked.</li>
                </ul>

                <br><article><b>Weakness:</b></article>
                <br><article>Nuts are a killer's weakness. Black Noir has a dangerous nut allergy, which causes anaphylactic shock and Super begins to choke and cannot continue the fight. If the antihistamine is not administered immediately, 
                    Noir may die (after the forcible introduction of chocolate with nuts into the body and the unavailability of the medicine, Noir fell into a 
                    long and difficult coma).</article>

                <br><article><b>Special and Martial Arts:</b></article>

                <ul>
                    <li>- Master of penetration and surveillance. He managed to quietly sneak into the base of Arab terrorists and kill all the guards without making a fuss. 
                        Creep up close and silently kill with his knives, using the darkness and the surprise factor. Was able to secretly follow a group of 
                        Boys and hunt them down, although he very stupidly caught the eye of Butcher, reflected in the mirror (probably did this on purpose). 
                        If the mission requires a quick kill, cut the throat or pierce the body through the heart through and through.
                         If desired, it can slowly beat the target, using everything in the environment: walls, columns, furniture and other interiors.</li>
                    </ul>

                <br><article><b>Experience:</b></article>
                <article>Overall level: experienced.</article>
                <article> Noir's experience is in battles against the super strong Female Kimiko, as a result, the assassin disabled her (he believed that he had killed, not knowing about her regeneration). Single-handedly defeated Billy Butcher, Mother's Milk and Hughie. He cut out entire detachments of terrorists, including the Super Terrorist, 
                    who creates an explosion around him, the strength of which is described above. 
                    Dominated the fight with Starlight and almost killed the heroine.</article>
