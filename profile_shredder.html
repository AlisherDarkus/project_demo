   <h3><b>Biography:</b></h3>
   <article> 300 years ago, consumed by the darkness of the demonic dragon - they, a young warrior, Oroku Saki usurped power over the Foot Clan from his father, 
    Oroku Magi. As leader, Saki led the clan to triumph, glory, and victory until he was killed in battle. In the present day, 
    his descendant, Oroku Karai, revived him in order for Saki to take his rightful place as leader of the Foot Clan, 
    where he again faced the reincarnation of his former rival, Hamato Yoshi, now called Splinter, and his four mutant sons, the ninja turtles.

                <article>Thanks to the training of the Arashikage, the ninja are able to walk on their hands across the signaled floor without being detected. 
                    To train balance, he can put swords vertically, with the blade on the floor and balance on them in a handstand.

                     from him and the enemy who did not see him in the pond could not feel or notice Arashikage.
                      Storm, without looking, spotted a GiJoe soldier hiding around the corner and, without turning around,

                <ul>
                    <li>-instantly hit the shuriken in vital organs and 
                        kill the target on the spot, but also 
                        to hit unprotected parts of the armor (like eyes); </li>
                </ul>
                <br><article><b>Endurance & survivability:</b></article>
                <article>Overall level: meta human.</article>
                <ul>
                    <li>- Easily takes blows similar to his own in strength, withstands many large cut wounds on the body, which does not affect the combat capability of the Shredder; </li>
                    <li>- Lacerations do not slow or excite Saki. A punch to the jaw of the 2 meter Krang's exoskeleton caused a slight bleeding and only disoriented the shinobi for a couple of seconds, after which Oroku continued the fight;</li>
                    <li>- Remained conscious after a massive and deep burn all over his back, although he was incapacitated;</li>
                    <li>- Alopex's blow, which drove Shredder into the ground so that it cracked, left no injuries;</li>
                    <li>- Master Foot's stamina is enough to single-handedly fight squads of ninjutsu masters or special forces squads and come out victorious without getting tired;</li>
                </ul>

                <br><article><b>Special and Martial Arts:</b></article>

                <ul>
                    <li>- Shredder's combat skills are the best in history and the only warrior who could be his equal is Hamato Yoshi, aka Splinter. 
                        He does not disdain dishonest dirty tricks, deceptive blows. Shredder is able to easily defeat Karai alone with three Foot ninjas 
                        (even ordinary Foot ninjas are able to fight on a par with armed special forces), while verbally humiliating them. He killed the sent ninjas, 
                        two of whom he killed with a single swing of the katana. Defeating all four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles alone is like a warm-up for Saki. 
                        Also, without straining, he defeated the fox killer Alopex, although she is able to kill 4 ninja masters, while blindfolding herself. 
                        Equal to Splinter that he was able to kill a dozen Foot Ninjas alone. 
                        In the first battle with Splinter, Shredder defeated the master rat, and lost to his brother later, having defeated all four turtle brothers before that.</li>

                <br><article><b>Experience:</b></article>
                <article>Overall level: elite.</article>
                <article>High intelligence, excellent leader, manipulator and strategist. In the three lives between rebirths, 
                    all three times Shredder became the great leader of the Foot Clan. Resurrected thanks to Karai, Saki quickly took her place as leader of the 
                    Foot Clan and forced her to work for him. Oroku quickly established total power in the clan and suppressed any actions and thoughts of seizing power.</article>

                <ul>
                    <li>-Steel pauldrons, bracers and leggings with blades. Even the weapons of the Ninja Turtles, which they use to cut steel robots, rebar and shotgun barrels, cannot penetrate Shredder's armor; </li>
                    <li>- Kabuto, similar to armor;</li>
                    <li>- Teko-kagi that cut steel and damage the Krang suit, the turtles' weapons are not capable of the latter;</li>
                    <li>- Shurikens. Sharp enough to stick into a metal wall;</li>
                    <li>- Katana similar to claws;</li>
